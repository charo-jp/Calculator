# Calculator Application

[Click Here](https://salty-eyrie-42519.herokuapp.com/) to have a look at my Calculator!

## Challenges I faced 
- I found it difficult to identify for a computer to consecutive string as a mathmatical formula. To achieve this, I used regular expressions.

- It is still hard for me to organize codes but this time I think I managed well especially css management. I use scss to do this and it gets much easier to maintain.
  - _base.scss        : element, color variables and mixin
  - _components.scss  : color, border, font-size
  - _layout.scss      : codes for layout such as flex
  - _space.scss       : margin
  - _base.scss        : import the 4 files above.

- when it comes to calculator function itself, I took hours to implement it. 

Please give me a feedback so that I can improve my skill!!
